For those suffering from an itchy scalp or dandruff, try applying some yoghurt straight to your scalp and hair and massaging in. Leave on for 10 minutes for a soothing hair and scalp treatment.",

Oily fish are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for healthy skin and keeping your scalp in good condition. Not only that, oily fish is also loaded with protein, which is essential for hair growth and strength, and iron, which can alleviate hair loss. To boost your body’s absorption of iron, try eating your oily fish sprinkled with vitamin C-rich lemon juice. ",
